Long story short, I had written a function that I assumed would always deal with a string of some length. This assumption was wrong. There were many times that this function was given an empty string and it had no idea how to deal with it. This resulted in an error that took many print statements to understand and resolve. It turns out this was an edge case that I had not accounted for in many of my other functions and I had to update many of them to do so."
